## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routing
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For handling APIs
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - For icons

### What I learned

**React**: I practiced making custom hooks and set up utilities for doing JavaScript functions. I hard coded some function, install packages,... and finally understand that sometimes you don't want your project to be too complex.
**axios**: I learned more about calling APIs from client side, dealing with Promises.
**Tailwind CSS**: I made some custom theme, added function to change between light mode and dark mode.

### Continued development

After this challenge, I understood that sometimes, the hardest part is to make your application simpler yet more efficient. I will study about this more in the future and hope that my code will be improved and cleaner.

### Useful resources

- [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) - Who ever makes this REST API for free is the real hero. Everything, every information I need to get with this project can be found with simple call to API, no need to register.
- And other helpers such as Google, Stack Overflow and Chat GPT,...
